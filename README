Description of petacopy
-----------------------
Petacopy is a (quick hack) file copy script. It resembles Codesector's
TeraCopy (www.teracopy.com).

What is working now:
* Accepts one file only as source.
* Accepts a new filename or a directory as destination.
* Write destination file and compute md5sum simultaneously while reading from
  source file once.
* Uses /dev/shm for temporary storage (FIFOs; No file data is actually
  written there.)


* TODO: Uses O_DIRECT for reading destination file md5 sum (avoiding pagecache
  hits.)

Planned:
* Error handling
* Help
* Man page
* Copy multiple files
* Recursive copy
* Program options:
  - set update interval
  - set copy speed limit
  - DONE: avoid overwritting destination
  - do not delete incomplete file on destination
  - resume incomplete file on destination
    (write as a new file then compare md5 if sucessful then delete
     incomplete file. In case of failed comparison, delete new file
     and keep incomplete file)
  - dd_rescue advanced options

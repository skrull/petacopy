Description of petacopy
-----------------------
Petacopy is a intelligent file copy script. It resembles Codesector's
TeraCopy (www.teracopy.com).

What is working now:
* Accepts one file only as source.
* Accepts a (new) filename or a directory as destination.
* Compute md5sums and copy file reading one time only from source.
* Catch SIGINT and SIGTERM and exits gracefully (will delete destination
  file.)
* Uses /dev/shm for temporary storage (md5 sum src & dst hashes; FIFOs.
  No file data is actually written there.)
* Uses O_DIRECT for reading destination file md5 sum (avoiding pagecache
  hits.)

Planned:
* Help
* Man page
* Copy multiple files
* Recursive copy
* Program options:
  - set update interval
  - set copy speed limit
  - avoid overwritting destination
  - do not delete incomplete file on destination
  - resume incomplete file on destination
    (write as a new file then compare md5 if sucessful then delete
     incomplete file. In case of failed comparison, delete new file
     and keep incomplete file)
  - dd_rescue advanced options
